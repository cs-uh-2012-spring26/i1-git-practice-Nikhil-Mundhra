## What I Found Most Interesting

The most interesting takeaway from this article is that AI is no longer just a coding assistant. IBM emphasizes that AI is reshaping the entire software development lifecycle, from turning plain language ideas into requirements, to generating tests, documentation, and monitoring systems after deployment. This shifts developers’ roles from writing everything manually to supervising, refining, and architecting systems with AI as a collaborator rather than a replacement.

Equally important is the balanced view on impact and risk. While AI boosts speed, productivity, and accessibility through low-code and no-code tools, IBM stresses that human oversight remains critical. Issues like biased outputs, security vulnerabilities, and skill erosion mean AI works best when developers actively review and guide it. The core insight is that the future of software development is not AI versus developers, but AI plus developers, with judgment and creativity still firmly human.

Amena: I personally enjoyed the section on job displacement because it doesn’t present AI as a threat that will replace software engineers, but as a tool that changes how they work. The article highlights that AI is something that augments human expertise instead of making it obsolete.
